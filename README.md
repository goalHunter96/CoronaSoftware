# CoronaSoftware
I'm trying to code a "Software" for a Corona Testing Center. This Software should be able to send the results to the selected Testperson. It also should delete 
a testperson, if this is required. The users are the employees of the Testing Center. 
The programming of this "Software" is for learning, so I can understand better how to code.
